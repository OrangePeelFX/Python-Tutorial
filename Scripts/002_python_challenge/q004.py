urllib may help. DON'T TRY ALL NOTHINGS, since it will never
end. 400 times is more than enough.

DÃ©but de la routine ici :
    http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php?nothing=12345

Opening URL: 16044
    Yes. Divide by two and keep going.

Opening URL: 82682
    There maybe misleading numbers in the
    text. One example is 82683. Look only for the next nothing and the next nothing is 63579
